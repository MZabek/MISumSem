## Test Cases:

These are things it would be good to check for in debugging new code (and why it may make sense to be more object oriented in doing things): 

1. Quotes in update sheet (and in general)
2. Unicode characters in:
   1. Database
   2. Forms
3. Null entries in particular columns of the dataset
4. Sheets only containing up to X row responses
5. Sending of emails, etc. logging
6. Email test with joint authors, etc...
