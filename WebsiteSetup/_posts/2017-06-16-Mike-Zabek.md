title: Mike Zabek - Family ties and worker displacement 
---


*Joint work with:* Patrick Coate and Pawel Krolikowski

The earnings of young adults who live near their parents fall by less after a job loss than those of young adults who live further from their parents. This positive effect diminishes only gradually with distance to one's parents. Most of these effects are driven by higher wages after job displacement, not by differences in the number of hours worked. The effect is not present for older workers who may be caring for elderly parents.
