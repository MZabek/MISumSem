Summer seminar happens from 11:30 am to 1 pm on Monadys, Wednesdays, and Fridays throughout the summer. It is an informal setting for students to present ongoing work in economics.  It is designed to allow graduate students to present to their peers, and sometimes to professors (speakers need to reach out to make this happen). The seminar has varied content, with the caveat that it focuses mostly on economists. 

Toward the end of the summer (i.e. August), potential job market candidates present preliminary versions of theit job market papers. 

If you would like to sign up for a slot that's open (a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday in the summer), then give us an email at <UMSumSem@gmail.com>. 

We also have a mailing list that you can join by emailing us at <UMSumSem@gmail.com>. 

About a week before your seminar, you should get an email to update your info, via a google form. Let us know if that's too late (or too early) for your liking. 

We are sad to report that you will have to bring your own lunch (GES, the department itself, and Rackham all declined to fund free lunch). In the summer, unfortunately, there are fewer free lunches for economists.
