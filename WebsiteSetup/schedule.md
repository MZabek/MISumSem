### Family ties and worker displacement

*Joint work with:* Patrick Coate and Pawel Krolikowski

The earnings of young adults who live near their parents fall by less after a job loss than those of young adults who live further from their parents. This positive effect diminishes only gradually with distance to one's parents. Most of these effects are driven by higher wages after job displacement, not by differences in the number of hours worked. The effect is not present for older workers who may be caring for elderly parents.

### A (Paid) Passage to India:  Quantifying the value of upper-caste status

How much are upper-caste individuals willing to pay for upper-caste status?  Traditional discrimination models view discrimination from the vantage point of a group that receives worse treatment due to its non-economic characteristics vis-a-vis a reference group.  Discriminated groups pay a cost in the labor market for these characteristics.  However, the corollary may be true:  a privileged group may pay a fee in order to receive better, rather than equal, treatment.  In the case of caste, I hypothesize that high-caste Indians abroad are willing to pay more to return to India and reap the labor and non-labor benefits of high-caste status.  I utilize unique data on indentured Indians in Fiji in the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries.  This context removes confounding labor-market factors and cleanly identifies the gross value of upper castes.  I show that the lower bound of the value of the highest castes in north India roughly 2.5 years' gross wages. The effects are entirely driven by men, as women's caste status appears delinked from return migration.  My results show some of the first evidence quantifying a caste's value and speak to caste's persistence today.

### Entrepreneurship among The Unemployed: the Effects of Unemployment Benefits and Past Experiences

This paper probes the drivers and constraints that affect an unemployed individual's decision to start a business. We find that unemployment benefits have a significantly negative effect on switching from unemployment to self-employment, especially to unincorporated self-employment. Moreover, unemployed individuals who lived in states with high unemployment levels in the past few years are more likely to become self-employed after being laid off.

### The fiscal impact of extreme weather events

This paper analyzes a panel dataset of 168 countries with information on natural disasters and macroeconomic variables for the period 2000-2015, with the objective of estimating the fiscal impact of extreme weather events.  According to the results, the occurrence of at least one extreme weather event is associated with an increase in the budget deficit between 0.4% and 0.8% of GDP. This impact comes primarily from an immediate reduction in government revenues, as a percentage of GDP, with some evidence pointing out to a lagged effect on public expenditure one or two years after the event.  The importance of these estimates comes from the link between climate change and extreme weather events, with some studies suggesting a higher frequency in the occurrence of extreme weather events due to the effects of climate change.

### Empirical Analysis under Limited Attention

*Joint work with:* Giacomo Brusco

We investigate the estimation of deadweight loss when a tax is less than fully salient. First, we provide a theoretical framework for deadweight loss analysis under limited attention. As a non-salient tax will induce a smaller behavioral response, deadweight loss will tend to be significantly smaller than an equal, fully salient tax. Further, the behavioral elasticity is no longer a sufficient statistic for deadweight loss, as true preferences determine the marginal value of foregone output. We go on to show that failing to account for limited attention will weakly overestimate excess burden, and we provide an empirical test for determining when this is strictly so. We perform an empirical excercise in deadweight loss estimation under limited attention, by analyzing responses in cigarette consumption to variation in excise tax (included in sticker prices) and sales taxes (added at the register). With data from Goldin and Homonoff (2013), we show that using only variation in sales taxes would lead to overestimating deadweight loss by a factor of 10, and that using only variation in sticker prices would lead to overestimating deadweight loss by a factor of 100.

### Firms’ (mis)reporting under a minimum tax: Evidence from Guatemalan corporate tax returns

This paper studies firm responses under a minimum tax in the context of a developing country. The study of such behavior is of great importance for societies in the developing world for two reasons. First, many of these countries suffer from chronically low tax revenues. Second, governments have been using production‐inefficient taxation for long, such as turnover and minimum taxes. Until recently, these policies were considered suboptimal from a social welfare perspective. The specific focus of the present analysis is the Guatemalan corporate income tax scheme faced by firms registered in Regimen Optativo. This scheme features maximum thresholds for cost deduction and a system of firm eligibility which depends on the firm’s cost structure. Such characteristics favor the study of behavioral responses using
bunching theory, providing a particular case in which incentives from both kinks and a notch coexist. The empirical evidence presented in this paper suggests strong firm responses, most of which seem in accordance with evasion behavior. The results presented are consistent with the view that minimum taxes can be an effective mechanism to lower tax evasion in environments with limited enforcement capabilities.

### Implications of local ties in spatial equilibrium

Local ties lead people to stay in declining areas. Using the share of people who were born in the same state that they live in as a proxy for local ties, I find that aggregate migration responses are smaller in areas where people's local ties are stronger. I develop a spatial equilibrium model where people have idiosyncratic ties to their "homes" and use it to derive welfare implications. In the model, declining areas attract fewer outsiders and have lower net migration elasticities. The lower migration elasticities in declining areas imply that welfare can decline by more without a migration response. They also imply that locally focused programs, like place based policies, lead to smaller dead weight losses.

### More Gains Than Score Gains? High School Accountability and College Success

While test-score value-added models are increasingly popular measures of school quality, concerns about their limitations remain. Schools may reallocate resources toward tested subjects or spend excess time on exam preparation, and standardized exams may not accurately measure content knowledge. I create a theoretical framework outlining how schools may allocate limited resources under high-stakes accountability, and follow it by examining the empirical relationship between schools' test-score value added and the grades their graduates earn at public colleges in Michigan. In preliminary results, I find that schools with high value added in reading contribute to better grades in college, both in English courses and in other subjects, while math value added has only a marginally-significant relationship with college math grades and no relationship with any other outcomes. The effects of attending a school with high reading value added are particularly large for black students and economically disadvantaged students.

### Identification and Estimation of Spillover Effects in Randomized Experiments

Despite the longstanding interest in spillover effects across different fields in economics and other social sciences, the empirical literature has not come to an agreement regarding identification and estimation in randomized experiments in the presence of externalities. This paper provides a causal framework to study spillover effects in a setting where units are clustered and their potential outcomes can depend on the treatment assignment of all the units within a cluster. Using this framework, I discuss parameters of interest and provide conditions under which spillover effects can be identified. I assess the performance of three commonly applied techniques, the difference in means, which ignores the presence of externalities, linear-in-means models and two-stage randomization designs. I then evaluate whether (or under what conditions) these three techniques identify the parameters of interest. Finally, I put forth easily implemented empirical strategies for estimating these spillover effects and I illustrate my proposed methodology using two empirical applications, one in education and one in political economy.

### Federal Transfers and Government Accountability in Indonesia

Subnational governments in developing countries rely heavily on transfers from 
the central government to finance public spending, yet there is little rigorous 
evidence on the relative merits of different transfer arrangements. 	
This paper examines the effects of two large unconditional federal grant 
programs in Indonesia.
The first is a general grant allocated according to fiscal need, with 
fairly stable disbursements over time. 
The second is shared oil and gas revenue and is quite volatile.
We exploit national policy reforms and variation in resource endowments to 
estimate the causal effects of the two grants on local public spending and 
provision of schools and health facilities.
Both grants induced greater reported spending in a manner that is consistent 
with governments spending out of permanent income. 
However, only the general grant led to an increase in local public good 
provision.
The results are consistent with a political agency model in 
which citizens are less able to detect and punish misbehaving politicians when 
the size of the public budget is more volatile.

### Airline Competition, Oil Price Pass-Through, and Carbon Taxes

*Joint work with:* Paul Brehm, Andrew Usher

We examine the relationship between airfares and oil prices in the Australian airline industry. We find pass-through rates in excess of 100% that vary depending on the amount of competition on a route. We also find evidence that different types of products have heterogeneous pass-through structures – pass-through rates on non-stop routes are more responsive to competition than on one-stop routes. Our results have important implications for environmental policy in industries with imperfect competition and differentiated products.

### The effects of experience rating on hiring: Evidence from Finland's Disability Pension

*Joint work with:* Salla Simola

The rising fraction of working-aged adults claiming Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), the solvency of the SSDI Trust Fund and the decline in employment among adults with disabilities have all contributed to the call for reform to SSDI in the United States. Given the limited success of previous reforms focusing on program generosity and eligibility, more recent proposals have focused on financially incentivizing employers to internalize the costs of their employees leaving the workforce and entering disability insurance (DI). Despite the promise of employer incentives, there are also possible downsides to consider. Shifting the liability of DI onto employers might also discourage firms from hiring people with pre-existing conditions, thus contributing to the unemployment of people with disabilities rather than ameliorating it. Therefore, we propose to study the effects of employer financial incentives on firms’ hiring decisions. Specifically, we will study rule changes in 1996 and 2000 to the Finnish Disability Pension system that increased firm liability if their employees are awarded disability benefits. Because these rule changes affected some firms but not others, we propose a difference-in-difference strategy to get at the relationship between firm financial incentives and firm hiring. 
We will use the Finnish Longitudinal Employer-Employee Dataset (FLEED) that contains a wealth of information on employees and firms to study the effects of these firm liability rules on firms’ hiring decisions, particularly of high-disability risk workers.
