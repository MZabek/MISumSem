### Family ties and worker displacement

*Joint work with:* Patrick Coate and Pawel Krolikowski

The earnings of young adults who live near their parents fall by less after a job loss than those of young adults who live further from their parents. This positive effect diminishes only gradually with distance to one's parents. Most of these effects are driven by higher wages after job displacement, not by differences in the number of hours worked. The effect is not present for older workers who may be caring for elderly parents.

### A (Paid) Passage to India:  Quantifying the value of upper-caste status

How much are upper-caste individuals willing to pay for upper-caste status?  Traditional discrimination models view discrimination from the vantage point of a group that receives worse treatment due to its non-economic characteristics vis-a-vis a reference group.  Discriminated groups pay a cost in the labor market for these characteristics.  However, the corollary may be true:  a privileged group may pay a fee in order to receive better, rather than equal, treatment.  In the case of caste, I hypothesize that high-caste Indians abroad are willing to pay more to return to India and reap the labor and non-labor benefits of high-caste status.  I utilize unique data on indentured Indians in Fiji in the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries.  This context removes confounding labor-market factors and cleanly identifies the gross value of upper castes.  I show that the lower bound of the value of the highest castes in north India roughly 2.5 years' gross wages. The effects are entirely driven by men, as women's caste status appears delinked from return migration.  My results show some of the first evidence quantifying a caste's value and speak to caste's persistence today.

### Implications of local ties in spatial equilibrium

Local ties lead people to stay in declining areas. Using the share of people who were born in the same state that they live in as a proxy for local ties, I find that aggregate migration responses are smaller in areas where people's local ties are stronger. I develop a spatial equilibrium model where people have idiosyncratic ties to their "homes" and use it to derive welfare implications. In the model, declining areas attract fewer outsiders and have lower net migration elasticities. The lower migration elasticities in declining areas imply that welfare can decline by more without a migration response. They also imply that locally focused programs, like place based policies, lead to smaller dead weight losses.

### Firms’ (mis)reporting under a minimum tax: Evidence from Guatemalan corporate tax returns

This paper studies firm responses under a minimum tax in the context of a developing country. The study of such behavior is of great importance for societies in the developing world for two reasons. First, many of these countries suffer from chronically low tax revenues. Second, governments have been using production‐inefficient taxation for long, such as turnover and minimum taxes. Until recently, these policies were considered suboptimal from a social welfare perspective. The specific focus of the present analysis is the Guatemalan corporate income tax scheme faced by firms registered in Regimen Optativo. This scheme features maximum thresholds for cost deduction and a system of firm eligibility which depends on the firm’s cost structure. Such characteristics favor the study of behavioral responses using
bunching theory, providing a particular case in which incentives from both kinks and a notch coexist. The empirical evidence presented in this paper suggests strong firm responses, most of which seem in accordance with evasion behavior. The results presented are consistent with the view that minimum taxes can be an effective mechanism to lower tax evasion in environments with limited enforcement capabilities.

### Federal Transfers and Government Accountability in Indonesia

Subnational governments in developing countries rely heavily on transfers from 
the central government to finance public spending, yet there is little rigorous 
evidence on the relative merits of different transfer arrangements. 	
This paper examines the effects of two large unconditional federal grant 
programs in Indonesia.
The first is a general grant allocated according to fiscal need, with 
fairly stable disbursements over time. 
The second is shared oil and gas revenue and is quite volatile.
We exploit national policy reforms and variation in resource endowments to 
estimate the causal effects of the two grants on local public spending and 
provision of schools and health facilities.
Both grants induced greater reported spending in a manner that is consistent 
with governments spending out of permanent income. 
However, only the general grant led to an increase in local public good 
provision.
The results are consistent with a political agency model in 
which citizens are less able to detect and punish misbehaving politicians when 
the size of the public budget is more volatile.
