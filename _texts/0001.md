The rise in female employment over the twentieth century radically changed the U.S. economy and the role of women in society. Time-series data show a rapid increase in the employment of mothers beginning in the mid-1970s, relative to women without children. In the first systematic study of the 1975 introduction of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), I show that this program led to a 5-percentage-point rise in the employment of all 16- to 45-year old mothers – representing over one million mothers – and conclude that the 1975 EITC can help explain why the U.S. has such a high fraction of working mothers despite little childcare subsidies or maternity leave policies. This large influx of mothers into the labor force affected social attitudes towards working women, and I show that after 1975, males living in areas with larger increases in maternal employment were less likely to report that women should not work (“stigma”). This result controls for state-specific “stigma” trends before 1975 and a rich set of covariates to distinguish changes in “stigma” from trends in other social norms. This paper shows that the 1975 EITC had a major impact on the United States.
