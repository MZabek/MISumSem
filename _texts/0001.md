title: Austin Davis - Why Did Sugarcane Growers Suddenly Adopt Old Technology? (August 01)
---


*Location:* Lorch 301

I investigate the role of regulation and economic growth in shifting Brazil's sugarcane industry from a dirty, manual harvest to a cleaner, mechanical harvest.  I use worker- and establishment-level data to test the regulation via complementary regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference approaches.  Estimates indicate that regulation is, at best, a partial explanation for the rapid, widespread change in harvesting practices.  Rising wages and increasing employment suggest that economic growth may have played an important role; instrumental variables estimates imply that increasing wages are sufficient to explain the adoption of green technology.
