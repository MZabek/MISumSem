title: Basel III Capital Requirements and Bank Credit Supply
---
## May 30 (Slot 1) - Owen Nie 

*Location:* Lorch 301

This paper studies the effect of the implementation of Basel III global bank-
ing regulatory rules on bank credit supply. I exploit cross-country differences in
the implementation schedule of Basel III rules and focus on capital requirement,
the rest and only Basel III rule already in force. Contrary to what relevant
theory would predict, the treatment effect of higher equity requirement in this
sample is an increase of aggregate credit supply of 5.6 percent on average. The
effects are identified only when announcement is used as measure of treatment,
not with publication of draft regulations or formal dates of implementation.
