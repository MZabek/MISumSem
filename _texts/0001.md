This paper proposes a general framework for thinking about US Treasury debt management. Using an approximate solution method, I obtain close-form solution for the optimal portfolio choice of the Treasury debt manager who faces real macroeconomic risks and uncertain bond returns described by a vector autoregression in returns and state variables. Empirical estimates show more realistic explanations of US Treasury maturity patterns. Furthermore, I examine the role of long term nominal government debt for risk management.
