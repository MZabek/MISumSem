title: Will Boning - Domestic Misallocation from 'Profit-shifting' FDI with Heterogeneous Firms (June 08)

## June 08 (Slot 1) - Will Boning

*Location:* Lorch 301

I model a distortionary corporate income tax in a setting where firms can pay a fixed cost to engage in purely 'Profit-shifting' FDI. When firms are heterogeneous, larger firms select into 'Profit-shifting' FDI that reduces the output distortion from the corporate income tax. The resulting general equilibrium price changes lower the output of non-shifting firms. When firms are heterogeneous, profit-shifting misallocates production among producing firms while a uniform but distortionary corporate income tax does not.
