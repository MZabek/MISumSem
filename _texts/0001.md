title: Yiyuan Zhang - Market Organization and Productive Efficiency - Evidence from the Texas Electricity Market (July 13)

*Location:* Lorch 301

This paper examines the impact of market organization on market efficiency and social welfare in the context of the Texas electricity market. Deregulated wholesale electricity markets exhibit two basic forms of organization: decentralized bilateral trading market and centralized auction market. The centralized market improves the management of congestion externalities, while it may also exacerbate the incentives faced by market participants to exercise market power. Taking advantage of Texas' transition from a bilaterally trading market to a centralized electricity pool, I show that the effect of the former dominates the latter. Using detailed generation data, I find that high-cost generators were displaced by low-cost generators. In the nine months following the transition, the generation cost was reduced by $24.7 million, about 0.4% of the total generation cost. However, the market redesign also led to increased carbon dioxide emissions, the external cost of which substantially offset the private efficiency gain.
