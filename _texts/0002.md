title: Will Boning - Domestic Misallocation from 'Profit-shifting' FDI with Heterogeneous Firms (June 08)

## June 08 (Slot 1) - Will Boning

*Location:* Lorch 301

When corporate taxation leads firms to reduce their output, selection by large, profitable firms into FDI for purely profit-shifting motives lowers shifting firms' tax-inclusive marginal costs. In general equilibrium with CES preferences as in Melitz (2003), if some firms do not shift profits, profit-shifting results in heterogeneous markups over real marginal cost, distorting the allocation of inputs from non-shifting to shifting firms. If the marginal producing firm does not shift, then profit-shifting raises the productivity threshold for production excessively, reducing variety and welfare. Heterogeneous, as opposed to homogeneous, profit-shifting has general equilibrium welfare effects.
