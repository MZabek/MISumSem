## June 08 (Slot 2) - Benjamin Glass

*Location:* Lorch 301

I describe a two-period general equilibrium model.  Agents buy and sell forward contracts in the first period.  The second period has an open economy state and a closed economy state.   If agents are risk-averse and all markets are both complete & undistorted, then all agents must weakly prefer that the open economy state obtain than that the closed economy state obtain.  Thus, there are no losers from trade.
