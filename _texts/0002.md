title: Xiaoqing Zhou - Home Equity Extraction and Consumer Spending (June 29)

##  (Slot 1)

*Location:* Lorch 301

This paper studies how home equity extraction changes consumption and housing investment behavior, and how shocks affect aggregate consumption and housing investment through the equity-based borrowing channel. First, I empirically document the spending pattern of home equity extractors. A significant fraction of equity cashed out is reinvested in housing wealth, either in the form of main residence improvement or real estate investment. Second, I build a model to study the implications of housing investment when equity can be cashed out with fixed costs. The model features an ``invest-to-borrow" and ``borrow-to-invest" behavior over the lifecycle. Third, I use the model to quantify the consumption and housing investment responses to aggregate shocks. While the consumption response is moderate, housing investment absorbs the most impact. This is because only equity extractors adjust consumption, but all homeowners adjust investment. Finally, I quantify the role of housing as collateral by shutting off the equity-based borrowing channel. Simulation results show that during the housing boom-bust cycle of 2000-2013, equity-based borrowing greatly amplified house price shocks.
