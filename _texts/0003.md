What are the economic consequences of immigrant disenfranchisement? This paper studies a little-known episode in United States history in which twenty-three states and territories disenfranchised non-citizen immigrants from 1864-1926. This disenfranchisement represented a significant shock to the political equilibrium of the time: mayoral and gubernatorial vote totals fell by 31% and 11%, respectively, in the years after disenfranchisement. Moreover, there is evidence that this political exclusion had real economic effects. Disenfranchised immigrants were less likely to obtain public employment, and, as measured in census samples from 1940-1960, children of immigrants who were exposed to disenfranchisement at an early age earned less, as adults, than comparable children of natives. This latter result appears to be driven by reductions in public spending at the time of disenfranchisement. Taken together, these results suggest that immigrant disenfranchisement led to non-trivial social welfare losses.
