title: Brenden Timpe - Short-Term Disability Insurance, Maternity Leave, and the Rise of Working Mothers (June 22)
---


*Location:* Lorch 301

In 1978, the U.S. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, a law 		that updated the Civil Rights Act to outlaw discrimination against women in 	the provision of employment benefits. In three large states that had long 		mandated or provided short-term disability insurance for virtually all workers, one consequence of this law was the de facto creation of a paid maternity leave benefit. I use the creation of this benefit, and its interaction with the Family and Medical Leave Act 15 years later, to study how women make labor supply and maternity-leave decisions, as well as the possible consequences of proposals to create a nationwide paid maternity leave benefit. I find that women in states with near-universal disability insurance coverage took more maternity leave after passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, with increases concentrated among lower-educated workers. Passage of the FMLA led to more leave-taking and greater labor-force participation for relatively advantaged women, though women did not appear to respond in states where they already had access to paid leave benefits through their disability insurance programs.
