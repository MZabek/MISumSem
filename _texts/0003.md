title: Julian Hsu - What is it Good For? Measuring College Major Investment with Courses (June 27)
---


*Location:* Lorch 301


Despite evidence college majors have substantial impacts on employment and earnings outcomes, there is little work about how college coursework shape students' decision. I fill this gap, and study how ability learning affects college course-taking. I develop a structural dynamic discrete choice model, where students take different combinations of courses to both learn about their major-specific abilities and graduate in different majors. I estimate my model using transcript data from a public four-year institution. 

There is a presentation of preliminary work - I am trying to weave together a narrative connecting tables to different facets to my model. The computer deities will determine whether I will have parameter estimates.
