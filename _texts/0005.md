Previous research has established that students learn best from teachers with at least a few years of experience, and that teacher quality is often distributed inequitably in a way that further disadvantages students of color and lower-income students. We use administrative data from Michigan's public school system to determine which factors are associated with teachers leaving their first jobs, and to look at where they go if they choose to change jobs. We find that teachers are more likely to leave when they teach more black students or more low-income students; teachers are less likely to leave if they attended college in Michigan or have master's degrees. Turnover patterns over the business cycle are also fascinating; teachers hired during a recession are less likely to leave, even as the labor market improves during their tenure, indicating that districts may be able to screen candidates effectively when the applicant pool is large.
