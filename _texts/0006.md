title: Mike Zabek - Implications of local ties in spatial equilibrium (June 17)

## June 17 - Mike Zabek

*Location:* Lorch 301

Local ties lead people to stay in declining areas. Using the proportion of people in an area who were born in the same place as a proxy for local ties, I find that migration elasticities are smaller in areas where local ties are stronger. To better understand the mechanisms, I develop a model of spatial equilibrium to match people's preferences about their birth places and make statements about spatial equilibrium across areas. The model generates important heterogeneity in migration elasticities across areas -- areas that have grown have lower average levels of local ties and higher migration elasticities. Declining areas, unlike growing areas, mostly house people who were born nearby and are unlikely to move after a shock to the local economy. Few people born outside of a declining area are likely to move into one. The lower migration elasticities in declining areas imply that real wages can decrease by more without a migration response to equalize welfare. They also imply that locally focused programs, like place based policies, will lead to smaller dead weight losses.
