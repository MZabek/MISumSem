title: Michael Gelman - What Drives Heterogeneity in the Marginal Propensity to Consume? Idiosyncratic Shocks vs Permanent Characteristics (August 15)
---


*Location:* Lorch 301

Heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of income changes play a prominent role in informing fiscal and tax policy as well as economic models. Yet there is still debate over what mechanisms drive this heterogeneity. One view posits that this heterogeneity stems solely from temporary idiosyncratic shocks, while the other suggests that it is driven by permanent individual characteristics in addition to these shocks. Existing studies have been unable to formally test these views since cross-sectional data cannot disentangle temporary shocks from individual characteristics. This paper tests these two views using novel administrative panel data that allow for precisely measured consumption and debt responses to tax refunds over four years. The main empirical finding is that temporary idiosyncratic shocks and permanent individual characteristics explain 52% and 48%, respectively, of the variance in the MPC attributable to cash on hand. Overall, the evidence supports the view that heterogeneity in permanent individual characteristics, such as the discount factor, play a key role in driving MPC heterogeneity.
