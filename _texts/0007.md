title: Mike Zabek - Implications of local ties in spatial equilibrium (June 17)

## June 17 - Mike Zabek

*Location:* Lorch 301

Local ties lead people to stay in declining areas. Areas with a high share of locally born workers (workers with stronger ties on average) have smaller aggregate migration responses after local labor demand shocks. To better understand the mechanisms, I develop a model of spatial equilibrium that matches some basic facts about peopleâ€™s preferences for their birth places. The model generates meaningful differences in migration elasticities across areas that have been growing and declining over the past thirty years. This follows naturally from declining areas having a higher proportion of residents who are inframarginal about living there. Lower elasticities in declining areas imply that real wages can decrease by more without a migration response to equalize welfare. Lower migration elasticities also imply that locally focused programs, like place based policies, will lead to smaller dead weight losses.
