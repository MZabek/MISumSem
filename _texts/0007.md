title: Consumer behavior in crowdfunding markets

Reward-based crowdfunding provides an alternative, relatively low risk way for entrepreneurs and small businesses to raise capital. We provide an empirical analysis of consumer dynamics, finding that consumers are more likely to pledge to a crowdfunding project the closer a project is to its goal, consistent with previous literature; the resulting effect is stronger for projects with large (>$100k) goals than for small ones. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic theoretical model based on individual consumer choice which implies this real world behavior under certain distributional assumptions.
