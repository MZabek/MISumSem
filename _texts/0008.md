*Location:* Lorch 301

In response to pressing concerns about prescription opioid abuse, Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in July 2016 with an overwhelming majority. The trend in prescription opioid misuse originally stems from an oversupply of legally acquired prescription opioids, which were used to address pain by well-intentioned providers. However, prescription behavior differs crucially by provider type. In particular, by combining state-level regulations for nurse practitioners with detailed prescription use data, I show that nurse practitioners (NPs) prescribe opioids more conservatively than physicians. Conditional on having at least one opioid prescription, I find that patients who live in states with more flexible NP prescription laws acquire 12.7\% fewer prescriptions than those living in more restrictive states. Although there is no detectable effect on the likelihood of acquiring an opioid prescription, I also find suggestive evidence that NPs may be substituting toward antidepressants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as alternative treatments for addressing the underlying source of pain symptoms.
