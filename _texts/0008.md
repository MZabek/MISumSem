Women participate in STEM careers at lower rates than men in many countries.
This situation represents a waste of creative intellectual resources and a potential shortfall of talent. STEM fields generally require more math and are more competitive to enter than other fields. However, men and women do not differ in terms of their innate cognitive abilities (OECD, 2015); so, all else equal, the observed differences in career choices across men and women remain a mystery. To contribute to our understanding of the gender gap in STEM, we conduct a pilot experiment in Colombia to provide evidence on two factors that may affect women's career choices. Specifically, we address the questions of whether and to what extent providing information about minimum scores in a college admissions test and encouragement to do STEM can induce girls to choose STEM majors and careers. The results from the pilot indicate that women in the treatment are more likely to choose a STEM major as a second choice and are more accurate in the scores they report as required to pass the admissions test.
