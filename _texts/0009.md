title: Population growth, decline, and shocks to local labor markets

I analyze the implications of peopleâ€™s ties to their birth places. These strong attachments lead people to stay in declining areas and lead to large differences in the share of residents born in the places where they reside. I develop an otherwise standard Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982) model of spatial equilibrium to match these facts and derive further implications. The model implies that areas will have different migration elasticities depending on whether they have been growing or declining. The reason is that declining areas attract residents that were mostly born locally, and these residents are more inelastic. Since migration tends to equalize real wages across space, one implication is that real wages can decrease by more in declining areas. Another implication is that place based policies designed to address these differences will lead to smaller distortions in declining areas. I find independent support for these differences in migration elasticities using reduced form regressions with plausibly exogenous local labor demand shifters.
