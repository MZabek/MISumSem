title: Social security and family ties- a positive theory
---
## August 29 - Giacomo Brusco

*Location:* Lorch 301

In this paper I present a model in which both family ties and social security policy are endogenously determined. My model shows how family values interact with policy preferences, resulting in the prediction that countries with strong family ties tend to have more generous social security systems. I supplement my theoretical work with empirical evidence at the country level, showing that countries with stronger family ties are associated with higher public spending on pensions, and at the individual level, showing that stronger family ties are associated with stronger support for social security spending in the U.S.
