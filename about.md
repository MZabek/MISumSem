Summer seminar provides a (very) informal setting for students to present preliminary and ongoing work.  The speakers are exclusively econ grad students, and the audience is mostly econ grad students (speakers are encouraged to reach out to the professors they wish to attend their talks).  The seminar is not field-specific; a wide range of topics will be presented and discussed over the course of the summer.

You should think of summer seminar as somewhere between an extremely preliminary conversation among friends about an idea, and the lunch seminars that happen during the semester (e.g. labor lunch, H2D2, etc.).

Toward the end of the summer (i.e. August onward), the seminar sometimes becomes a venue for upcoming job market candidates to practice their job market talks, although it remains very informal and attended almost exclusively by students.
