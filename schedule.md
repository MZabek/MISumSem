### Domestic Misallocation from 'Profit-shifting' FDI with Heterogeneous Firms

*Location:* Lorch 301

I model a distortionary corporate income tax in a setting where firms can pay a fixed cost to engage in purely 'Profit-shifting' FDI. When firms are heterogeneous, larger firms select into 'Profit-shifting' FDI that reduces the output distortion from the corporate income tax. The resulting general equilibrium price changes lower the output of non-shifting firms. When firms are heterogeneous, profit-shifting misallocates production among producing firms while a uniform but distortionary corporate income tax does not.

### Insuring Against Trade Shocks

*Location:* Lorch 301

I describe a two-period general equilibrium model.  Agents buy and sell forward contracts in the first period.  The second period has an open economy state and a closed economy state.   If agents are risk-averse and all markets are both complete & undistorted, then all agents must weakly prefer that the open economy state obtain than that the closed economy state obtain.  Thus, there are no losers from trade.

### On-the-job Leisure: Hours Worked vs. Hours at Work

*Location:* Lorch 301

Americans have substantial leisure time at work, reporting on average about an hour a day.  Using Gallup survey data, I show how on-the-job leisure varies across demographic groups, and I find that workers are less likely to report on-the-job leisure the higher is the state unemployment rate, consistent with the Shapiro-Stiglitz theory of unemployment as a discipline device.  The Gallup poll also includes measures of job satisfaction, information I aim to use to characterize preferences for on-the-job leisure.  Non-work time at work and job satisfaction are negatively correlated: People with more on-the-job leisure report lower job satisfaction, suggesting people may prefer more engaging work to boredom.  This project is preliminary and I welcome feedback.

### Consumer behavior in crowdfunding markets

*Location:* Lorch 301

Reward-based crowdfunding provides an alternative, relatively low risk way for entrepreneurs and small businesses to raise capital. We provide an empirical analysis of consumer dynamics, finding that consumers are more likely to pledge to a crowdfunding project the closer a project is to its goal, consistent with previous literature; the resulting effect is stronger for projects with large (>$100k) goals than for small ones. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic theoretical model based on individual consumer choice which implies this real world behavior under certain distributional assumptions.

### Implications of local ties in spatial equilibrium

*Location:* Lorch 301

Local ties lead people to stay in declining areas. Using the share of an area's population that was born locally as a proxy for local ties, I find that migration elasticities are smaller in areas where local ties are stronger. I develop a model of spatial equilibrium to highlight the mechanisms that make individuals' local ties matter for aggregate outcomes and to derive welfare implication in spatial equilibrium. The model generates important heterogeneity in migration elasticities across areas -- areas that have grown have lower average levels of local ties and higher migration elasticities. Declining areas, unlike growing areas, mostly house people who were born nearby and are unlikely to move after a shock to the local economy. Few people born outside of a declining area are likely to move into one. The lower migration elasticities in declining areas imply that real wages can decrease by more without a migration response. They also imply that locally focused programs, like place based policies, will lead to smaller dead weight losses.

### Short-Term Disability Insurance, Maternity Leave, and the Rise of Working Mothers

*Location:* Lorch 301

In 1978, the U.S. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, a law 		that updated the Civil Rights Act to outlaw discrimination against women in 	the provision of employment benefits. In three large states that had long 		mandated or provided short-term disability insurance for virtually all workers, one consequence of this law was the de facto creation of a paid maternity leave benefit. I use the creation of this benefit, and its interaction with the Family and Medical Leave Act 15 years later, to study how women make labor supply and maternity-leave decisions, as well as the possible consequences of proposals to create a nationwide paid maternity leave benefit. I find that women in states with near-universal disability insurance coverage took more maternity leave after passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, with increases concentrated among lower-educated workers. Passage of the FMLA led to more leave-taking and greater labor-force participation for relatively advantaged women, though women did not appear to respond in states where they already had access to paid leave benefits through their disability insurance programs.

### What is it Good For? Measuring College Major Investment with Courses

*Location:* Lorch 301


Despite evidence college majors have substantial impacts on employment and earnings outcomes, there is little work about how college coursework shape students' decision. I fill this gap, and study how ability learning affects college course-taking. I develop a structural dynamic discrete choice model, where students take different combinations of courses to both learn about their major-specific abilities and graduate in different majors. I estimate my model using transcript data from a public four-year institution. 

There is a presentation of preliminary work - I am trying to weave together a narrative connecting tables to different facets to my model. The computer deities will determine whether I will have parameter estimates.

### Home Equity Extraction and Consumer Spending

*Location:* Lorch 301

This paper studies how home equity extraction changes consumption and housing investment behavior, and how shocks affect aggregate consumption and housing investment through the equity-based borrowing channel. First, I empirically document the spending pattern of home equity extractors. A significant fraction of equity cashed out is reinvested in housing wealth, either in the form of main residence improvement or real estate investment. Second, I build a model to study the implications of housing investment when equity can be cashed out with fixed costs. The model features an ``invest-to-borrow" and ``borrow-to-invest" behavior over the lifecycle. Third, I use the model to quantify the consumption and housing investment responses to aggregate shocks. While the consumption response is moderate, housing investment absorbs the most impact. This is because only equity extractors adjust consumption, but all homeowners adjust investment. Finally, I quantify the role of housing as collateral by shutting off the equity-based borrowing channel. Simulation results show that during the housing boom-bust cycle of 2000-2013, equity-based borrowing greatly amplified house price shocks.

### Survival of the Fittest: Corporate Control and the Cleansing Effect of Financial Crises

*Joint work with:* Rahul Mukherjee (Graduate Institute, Geneva)

*Location:* Lorch 301

We develop a tractable model to study the effects of financial crises on M\&As. Acquisitions by financially constrained acquirers during crises involve higher average productivity, ownership stakes, and post-acquisition survival rates compared to unconstrained acquirers. These differences result from the interplay of fixed costs and financial constraints, leaving low-productivity acquisitions particularly vulnerable to financial shocks. Our model implies that M\&As lead to cleansing effects of financial crises because high-productivity firms are saved from bankruptcy, but these effects decline when acquirers are constrained. We provide novel evidence for the differential impact of financial crises on acquisitions by constrained and unconstrained firms.

### The Causes and Consequences of Teacher Turnover

*Joint work with:* Kolby Gadd, Brian Jacob

*Location:* Lorch 301

Previous research has established that students learn best from teachers with at least a few years of experience, and that teacher quality is often distributed inequitably in a way that further disadvantages students of color and lower-income students. We use administrative data from Michigan's public school system to determine which factors are associated with teachers leaving their first jobs, and to look at where they go if they choose to change jobs. We find that teachers are more likely to leave when they teach more black students or more low-income students; teachers are less likely to leave if they attended college in Michigan or have master's degrees. Turnover patterns over the business cycle are also fascinating; teachers hired during a recession are less likely to leave, even as the labor market improves during their tenure, indicating that districts may be able to screen candidates effectively when the applicant pool is large.

### Market Organization and Productive Efficiency: Evidence from the Texas Electricity Market

*Location:* Lorch 301

This paper examines the impact of market organization on market efficiency and social welfare in the context of the Texas electricity market. Deregulated wholesale electricity markets exhibit two basic forms of organization: decentralized bilateral trading market and centralized auction market. The centralized market improves the management of congestion externalities, while it may also exacerbate the incentives faced by market participants to exercise market power. Taking advantage of Texas' transition from a bilaterally trading market to a centralized electricity pool, I show that the effect of the former dominates the latter. Using detailed generation data, I find that high-cost generators were displaced by low-cost generators. In the nine months following the transition, the generation cost was reduced by $24.7 million, about 0.4% of the total generation cost. However, the market redesign also led to increased carbon dioxide emissions, the external cost of which substantially offset the private efficiency gain.

### Pension Eligibility, Labor Supply, and Credit Constraints: Evidence From Brazil

*Location:* Lorch 301

Elderly workers in developing countries face certain concerns in their retirement decisions that may not be as common among their counterparts in the developed world. In this study, I firstly show that elderly workers in Brazil react contemporaneously to pension eligibility by reducing their labor supply. I argue that this is due to an income effect rather than a substitution effect, and as such, workers should not react contemporaneously unless optimization frictions, such as credit constraints, are at work. Secondly, I show that the kinds of workers driving the effect are more likely to be credit constrained. Finally, I develop a simple model of retirement decisions to estimate bounds for the welfare costs these credit constraints may be incurring through the disutility of labor.

### The effect of a permanent change in income on economic decision making

*Joint work with:* Meera Mahadevan

*Location:* Lorch 301

This project seeks to contribute to the literature studying the causal effect of poverty on economic decision-making. Previous studies have found evidence that when individuals are poor, they are more present-biased and their performance in a cognitive test is worse than when their liquidity constraint is alleviated. These results emerge from analyzing short-term variations in income but so far, there is no evidence of how permanent changes in income affect economic decision-making. We propose a design in which the permanent change in flow income is given by the transition from college to the labor market. By following students, who range from lower to higher income backgrounds, about to graduate in a university in Colombia, we are able to assess whether economic decision-making changes along the transition from college to the labor market.

### The Economic Consequences of Immigrant Disenfranchisement

*Location:* Lorch 301

From 1864 to 1926, twenty-three states and territories disenfranchised non-citizen immigrants, which represented a significant shock to electorates at the time. I estimate the effects of this disenfranchisement on voting outcomes, public spending, and crime. I find that it resulted in an immediate and sustained drop in mayoral and gubernatorial vote totals, with large effect sizes relative to the magnitude of the disenfranchised population. Consistent with findings from political science, the largest reductions in vote totals were concentrated in the politically uncompetitive states. I find little evidence that disenfranchisement affected partisan vote shares. States significantly reduced their spending, both in aggregate and as a share of the budget, directed toward education and social services, and there is suggestive evidence that cities significantly reduced their spending on water services. Consistent with a model of local political vote maximization with imperfect screening, I document a substantial reduction in the likelihood of a disenfranchised immigrant obtaining public employment. Finally, I present suggestive evidence that disenfranchisement led to a temporary increase in homicide rates.

### Social security and family ties: a positive theory

*Location:* Lorch 301

In this paper I present a model in which both family ties and social security policy are endogenously determined. My model shows how family values interact with policy preferences, resulting in the prediction that countries with strong family ties tend to have more generous social security systems. I supplement my theoretical work with empirical evidence at the country level, showing that countries with stronger family ties are associated with higher public spending on pensions, and at the individual level, showing that stronger family ties are associated with stronger support for social security spending in the U.S.

### The IT Boom and other Unintended Consequences of the American Dream

*Location:* Lorch 301

We use a general equilibrium model to study how the US internet boom and concurrent immigration policies led to a tech boom in India. Specically, we test the hypothesis that Indian students enrolled in engineering schools to gain employment in the rapidly growing US IT industry via the H-1B visa program. Those who could not join the US workforce remained in India, enabling the growth of an IT sector. Those who returned with acquired human capital and technology after the expiration of their H-1Bs, also contributed to the growing tech-workforce in India. The increase in IT sector productivity allowed India to eventually surpass the US in IT exports. The paper develops a general quilibrium
model of firm-hiring, and of worker decisions to study and choose occupations in both the US and India supported by a rich descriptive analysis of the changes in the 1990s and early 2000s. We calibrate this model and perform counterfactual exercises to study the impact of immigration policies on the growth of these sectors in both countries. We find that the H-1B program induced Indians to switch to computer science (CS) occupations, increasing the non-migrant CS workforce in India by 4.9% in 2010. It also induced US workers to switch to non-CS occupations, reducing the US native CS workforce by 7%. Indian IT output is higher by 1.8%, India's share in world IT production greater by 8.9%, and the combined income of both countries is higher by 1.5% under the H-1B program
